\usage{
robustMultExpSmoothing(
  R,
  smoothMat = NA,
  startup_period = 10,
  training_period = 60,
  seed = 9999,
  trials = 50,
  method = "L-BFGS-B",
  lambda = 0.2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{data}

\item{smoothMat}{Optimal smoothing matrix. If missing it is estimated. 
The procedure maybe very slow for high-dimensional data. Also,
the objective function being very noisy, optimization across
multiple runs may lead to different smoothing matrices. #'}

\item{startup_period}{length of samples required to calculate initial values}

\item{training_period}{length of samples required to calculate forecast errors
for evalualating the objective if smoothing matrix is estimated}

\item{seed}{random seed to replicate the starting values for optimization}

\item{trials}{number of strarting values to try for any optimization. 
Large number of trials for high dimensions can be time consuming}

\item{method}{optimization method to use to evaluate an estimate of 
smoothing matrix. Default is L-BFGS-B}

\item{lambda}{known constant as described in the paper. Defaults to 0.2}
