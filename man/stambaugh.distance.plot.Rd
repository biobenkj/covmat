\title{Compute Mahalanobis distances for each of the data points and plot it against
upper 2.5\% chi-square quantile}
\usage{
stambaugh.distance.plot(model, level = 0.975)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{fitted models for covariance}

\item{level}{value between 0 and 1 giving the chi-squared percent point 
used to compute threshold for juding a point as an outlier}
}
\description{
Compute Mahalanobis distances for each of the data points and plot it against
upper 2.5\% chi-square quantile
}
\details{
This method takes in fitted models for Stamgaugh Estimator. It then uses the 
distances computed for each stage and plots it against the upper level\% 
Chi-Square quantile
