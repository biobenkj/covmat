\item{R}{xts or matrix of asset returns}

\item{...}{allows passing additional paramters}

\description{
Implement Stamgaugh Covariance estimate for multiple starting dates
}
\details{
This method takes in data as a matrix or an xts object where multiple
time series with different starting dates are merged together. It then
computes a covariance estimator as described in Stambugh (1997). Covariance
estimate can also be robustified
